# Gerobug


__The first open source self-managed bug bounty platform.__

Are you a company, planning to have your own bug bounty program, with minimum budget? ü§î<br>

__WE GOT YOU! ü´µ__

We are aware that some organizations have had difficulty establishing their own bug bounty program. üò∞<br>
Using a third-party managed platform usually comes with a hefty price tag and security risks. üôä _(If you know, you know...)_<br>
In the other hand, creating your own self-managed platform will take time and effort to build and maintain it. üòì

<br>

## Why Gerobug?

- __SECURE      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:__ Gerobug uses email parser and network segregation to minimize security risks. ü¶æ
- __OPEN SOURCE &nbsp;&nbsp;:__ It is FREE. ü§©
